** Linear Regression **

History:
This all started in 1800's with a guy named Francis Galton. 
Galton was studying the relationship between parents and their children.
In particular, he investigated the relationship between the heights of father and their sons.

What he dicovered was that a man's son tended to be roughly as tall as his father.
However, Galton's breakthrough was that the son's height 'tended to be closer to the overall average' height of all people

Galton's "Phenomenon Regression", a father's son's height tends to regress(or drift towards) the mean(average) height


Our goal with linear regression is to 'minimize the vertical distance' between all the data points and our line
So in determining the 'best line', we are attempting to minimize the distance between all the points and their distance to our line

There are lots of differnt ways to minimize this, (sum of squared errors, sum of absolute errors etc.), but all these methods have a general goal of minimizing this distance.


Problem Statement:
To create a model to predict housing prices based off of existing features.
